# Database Migrations with Alembic

This directory contains database migrations for the TaskManager application.

## Structure

- `versions/`: Contains all migration scripts
- `env.py`: Alembic environment configuration
- `script.py.mako`: Template for new migration files

## Usage

### Create a New Migration

```powershell
alembic revision -m "description_of_changes"
```

### Run Migrations

Apply all pending migrations:
```powershell
alembic upgrade head
```

Revert last migration:
```powershell
alembic downgrade -1
```

### Check Migration Status

View current migration state:
```powershell
alembic current
```

View migration history:
```powershell
alembic history
```

## Migration Files

Each migration file in `versions/` contains:
- Unique revision ID
- Dependencies (previous migrations)
- Upgrade operations (apply changes)
- Downgrade operations (revert changes)

## Important Notes

1. Always test migrations on a development database first
2. Back up production database before applying migrations
3. Review migration files before applying them
4. Keep migrations small and focused
